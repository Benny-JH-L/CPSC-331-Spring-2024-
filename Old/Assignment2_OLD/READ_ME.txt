This folder is not considered as a "java project", so it has been renamed to old,
code does work and functions as it should. 

HOWEVER, in the 'Modified_ShuntingYard_Evaluation.java' file, converting from 
infix to postfix will work for single digit numbers! Anynumber larger than 9 or less than 0, or is a double
will not be converted/calculated properly. (Need to ask TA about this - May 29 2024 Comment).
