This folder is not considered as a "java project", so it has been renamed to old,
code does work and functions as it should. 

HOWEVER, in the 'Modified_ShuntingYard_Evaluation.java' file, converting from 
infix to postfix will work for single digit numbers! Anynumber larger than 9 or less than 0, or is a double
will not be converted/calculated properly. (Need to ask TA about this - May 29 2024 Comment).


UPDATE (May 30 2024)
TA responded that we do not need to worry about unary operations like sine, cosine, tangent, etc., nor do we 
have to worry about numbers being longer than 1 digit. (Numbers tested are from 0-9).
